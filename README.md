# Language Detection Using ML



This project detects the language of short text inputs using a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. Built with Python in Jupyter Notebook, it uses CountVectorizer to transform text into numerical features. Trained on 21,999 samples, the model achieves 95.3% accuracy and makes predictions in milliseconds. Ideal for lightweight, multilingual applications such as chatbots or content filters.
